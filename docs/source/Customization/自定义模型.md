# Custom Model

The built-in models in ms-swift can be used directly by specifying `model_id` or `model_path` with the command: `--model <model_id_or_path>`. ms-swift determines the `model_type` based on the suffix of `model_id/model_path` and the `config.json` file. Each `model_type` has a unique model structure, template, and loading method. You can also manually pass `--model_type` and `--template` to override these settings. For a list of supported `model_type` and templates, you can refer to [Supported Models and Datasets](../Instruction/Supported_Models_and_Datasets.md).

> [!TIP]
> When using `swift sft` to fine-tune a base model into a chat model using LoRA technology (for example, fine-tuning Llama3.2-1B into a chat model), you may need to manually set the template. Adding `--template default` can help avoid issues where the base model cannot stop properly due to encountering special characters in an unseen chat template.

## Model Registration

Please refer to the example code in [examples](https://github.com/modelscope/swift/blob/main/examples/custom). You can parse the registered content by specifying `--custom_register_path xxx.py`.
