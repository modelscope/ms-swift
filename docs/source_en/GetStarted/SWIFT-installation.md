# SWIFT Installation

## Wheel Packages Installation

You can install it using pip:

```shell
pip install 'ms-swift'
# For evaluation usage
pip install 'ms-swift[eval]' -U
# For sequence parallel usage
pip install 'ms-swift[seq_parallel]' -U
# Full capabilities
pip install 'ms-swift[all]' -U
```

## Source Code Installation

```shell
# pip install git+https://github.com/modelscope/ms-swift.git

git clone https://github.com/modelscope/ms-swift.git
cd ms-swift
pip install -e .

# Full capabilities
# pip install -e '.[all]'
```

## Older Versions

SWIFT underwent an incompatible restructuring starting from version 3.0. If you need to use the old version 2.x, please execute the following command to install:

```shell
pip install ms-swift==2.*
```
