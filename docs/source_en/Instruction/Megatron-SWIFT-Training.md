# Megatron-SWIFT Training

SWIFT incorporates Megatron's parallelization techniques to accelerate the training of large models, including data parallelism, tensor parallelism, pipeline parallelism, sequence parallelism, and context parallelism. For models that support Megatron training, please refer to the [Supported Models and Datasets documentation](./Supported-models-and-datasets.md).

## Environment Setup

To use Megatron-SWIFT, in addition to installing the `swift` dependencies, you also need to install the following:

```shell
pip install pybind11
# transformer_engine
pip install git+https://github.com/NVIDIA/TransformerEngine.git@stable

# apex
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex
cd apex
pip install -v --disable-pip-version-check --no-cache-dir --no-build-isolation --config-settings "--build-option=--cpp_ext" --config-settings "--build-option=--cuda_ext" ./
```

The dependency library Megatron-LM will be git cloned and installed by swift, no manual installation by the user is required. You can also use the environment variable `MEGATRON_LM_PATH` to point to the already downloaded repo path (for offline environments, use the [core_r0.11.0 branch](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM/tree/core_r0.11.0)).


## Quick Start Example

This section introduces a quick start example for fine-tuning the self-awareness of the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model using two 80GiB A100 GPUs. The following best practices can be completed within 10 minutes.

First, we need to convert the weights from HF (Hugging Face) format to Megatron format:

```shell
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 \
swift export \
    --model Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct \
    --to_mcore true \
    --torch_dtype bfloat16 \
    --test_convert_precision true \
    --output_dir Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-mcore
```

Next, use the following script to start training. The required GPU memory resources are 2*80GiB:

```shell
NPROC_PER_NODE=2 \
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 \
megatron sft \
    --load Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-mcore \
    --dataset 'AI-ModelScope/alpaca-gpt4-data-zh#500' \
              'AI-ModelScope/alpaca-gpt4-data-en#500' \
              'swift/self-cognition#500' \
    --tensor_model_parallel_size 2 \
    --micro_batch_size 4 \
    --global_batch_size 16 \
    --recompute_granularity selective \
    --train_iters 100 \
    --eval_iters 5 \
    --finetune true \
    --cross_entropy_loss_fusion true \
    --lr 1e-5 \
    --lr_warmup_iters 10 \
    --min_lr 1e-6 \
    --save megatron_output/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct \
    --save_interval 100 \
    --max_length 2048 \
    --system 'You are a helpful assistant.' \
    --num_workers 4 \
    --no_save_optim true \
    --no_save_rng true \
    --dataset_num_proc 4 \
    --model_author swift \
    --model_name swift-robot
```

Finally, convert the Megatron format weights back to HF format:

```shell
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 \
swift export \
    --mcore_model megatron_output/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct/vx-xxx \
    --to_hf true \
    --torch_dtype bfloat16 \
    --test_convert_precision true \
    --output_dir megatron_output/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct/vx-xxx-hf
```

We then perform inference on the generated HF format weights:

```shell
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 \
swift infer \
    --model megatron_output/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct/vx-xxx-hf \
    --stream true \
    --temperature 0 \
    --max_new_tokens 2048
```

The inference results are as follows:

```
<<< who are you?
I am a language model developed by swift, you can call me swift-robot. How can I assist you?
```

- More examples: such as packing and multi-machine, can be found [here](https://github.com/modelscope/ms-swift/tree/main/examples/train/megatron).
- For pretraining, you can use `megatron pt` instead of `megatron sft`, which will use a generative template for training.

## Command Line Arguments

### Megatron Parameters

**Training Parameters**:

- ðŸ”¥micro_batch_size: Batch size per device, default is 1.
- ðŸ”¥global_batch_size: Total batch size, equivalent to `micro_batch_size * data parallel size * gradient accumulation steps`. Default is 16.
- ðŸ”¥recompute_granularity: Granularity of activation recomputation, options are 'full', 'selective'. 'full' means recomputing the entire transformer layer, while 'selective' means only recomputing the core attention part of the transformer layer. 'selective' is generally recommended.

### Megatron Training Parameters

Megatron training parameters inherit from Megatron parameters and basic parameters. For information on basic parameters, see [here](./Command-line-parameters.md#base-arguments). Additionally, the following parameters are included:

- add_version: Adds a directory `<version>-<timestamp>` to `save` to prevent overwriting weights, default is True.
- ðŸ”¥packing: Whether to use sequence packing, defaults to False.
- ðŸ”¥streaming: Stream reading and processing of the dataset, default is False. It is typically set to True when handling large datasets.
- lazy_tokenize: Default is False. If this parameter is set to False, all dataset samples are tokenized before training (this avoids errors during training); if set to True, tokenization occurs during training (this saves memory).
