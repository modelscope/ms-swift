## Environment Preparation
GPU devices: A10, 3090, V100, A100 are all supported.
```bash
# Install ms-swift
pip install 'ms-swift[llm]' -U

# If you want to use models based on auto_gptq for inference.
# Models using auto_gptq: `https://github.com/modelscope/swift/blob/main/docs/source/Instruction/Supported Models and Datasets.md#Models`
# auto_gptq and cuda versions have a correspondence, please select the version according to `https://github.com/PanQiWei/AutoGPTQ#quick-installation`
pip install auto_gptq -U

# Environment alignment (usually no need to run. If you encounter errors, you can run the code below, the latest environment is tested with the repository)
pip install -r requirements/framework.txt  -U
pip install -r requirements/llm.txt  -U
```
