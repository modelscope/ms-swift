# Command Line Arguments

## Megatron Parameters

**Training Parameters**:

- 🔥micro_batch_size: Batch size per device, default is 1.
- 🔥global_batch_size: Total batch size, equivalent to `micro_batch_size * data parallel size * gradient accumulation steps`. Default is 16.
- 🔥recompute_granularity: Granularity of activation recomputation, options are 'full', 'selective'. 'full' means recomputing the entire transformer layer, while 'selective' means only recomputing the core attention part of the transformer layer. 'selective' is generally recommended. Default is 'selective'.
- 🔥recompute_method: This parameter takes effect only when recompute_granularity is set to 'full', options are 'uniform', 'block'. Default is None.
- 🔥recompute_num_layers: This parameter takes effect only when recompute_granularity is set to 'full'. Default is None. If `recompute_method` is set to uniform, this parameter specifies the number of transformer layers in each uniformly divided recomputation unit. For example, you can specify `--recompute_granularity full --recompute_method uniform --recompute_num_layers 4`. The larger the recompute_num_layers, the smaller the memory usage but higher computation cost. Default is None.
- recompute_modules: Options include "core_attn", "moe_act", "layernorm", "mla_up_proj", "mlp", and "moe". The default value is `["core_attn"]`. This parameter takes effect when `--recompute_granularity selective` is set. For example, during MoE training, you can reduce memory usage by specifying `--recompute_granularity selective --recompute_modules core_attn moe`. Among these, "core_attn", "mlp", and "moe" use normal checkpointing, while "moe_act", "layernorm", and "mla_up_proj" use output-discarding checkpointing.

**Logging Parameters**:

- log_params_norm: Logs the norm of parameters. Default is False.

**Tuner Parameters**:

- train_type: Options are `'lora'` and `'full'`. Default is `'full'`.
- 🔥freeze_llm: This parameter only takes effect for multimodal models and can be used in both full-parameter and LoRA training, but with different behaviors. In full-parameter training, setting `freeze_llm` to `True` will freeze the weights of the LLM component. In LoRA training with `target_modules` set to 'all-linear', setting `freeze_llm` to `True` will prevent LoRA modules from being added to the LLM component. The default value is `False`.
- 🔥freeze_vit: This parameter only applies to multimodal models and can be used in both full-parameter and LoRA training, though with different effects. In full-parameter training, setting `freeze_vit` to `True` will freeze the weights of the ViT component. In LoRA training with `target_modules` set to 'all-linear', setting `freeze_vit` to `True` will prevent LoRA modules from being added to the ViT component. The default value is `True`.
  - Note: The term "ViT" here refers not only to the vision tower but also includes the audio tower.
- 🔥freeze_aligner: This parameter is only effective for multimodal models and can be used in both full-parameter and LoRA training, with differing outcomes. In full-parameter training, setting `freeze_aligner` to `True` will freeze the weights of the aligner (also known as the projector) component. In LoRA training with `target_modules` set to 'all-linear', setting `freeze_aligner` to `True` will prevent LoRA modules from being added to the aligner component. The default value is `True`.

Full-parameter Training:

- freeze_parameters: Prefixes of parameters to be frozen. Default is `[]`.
- freeze_parameters_regex: Regex expression for parameters to be frozen. Default is `None`.
- freeze_parameters_ratio: The proportion of parameters to freeze from bottom to top. Default is `0`. Setting this to `1` will freeze all parameters; you can set trainable parameters separately using `trainable_parameters`. This parameter is incompatible with PP (pipeline parallel) mode.
- trainable_parameters: Prefixes of additional trainable parameters. Default is `[]`.
- trainable_parameters_regex: Regex expression to match additional trainable parameters. Default is `None`.

LoRA Training:

- adapter_load: The path to the adapter weights for loading, used for resuming LoRA training from a checkpoint. The default is None. The method for resuming LoRA training from a checkpoint is the same as for full-parameter training. Please pay attention to the meaning of the `--finetune` parameter.
- 🔥target_modules: Specifies the suffixes of modules to apply LoRA to. For example, you can set it as `--target_modules linear_qkv linear_proj`. The default is `['all-linear']`, which means all linear layers will be set as target modules.
  - Note: If you want to set all router layers as target modules, you can specify `--target_modules all-router ...`. For example: `--target_modules all-router all-linear`.
- 🔥target_regex: Regex expression to specify LoRA modules. Default is `None`. If this value is provided, the `target_modules` parameter will be ignored.
- 🔥modules_to_save: After attaching a tuner, explicitly specifies additional original model modules to participate in training and storage. The default is `[]`.
- 🔥lora_rank: Default is `8`.
- 🔥lora_alpha: Default is `32`.
- lora_dropout: Default is `0.05`.
- lora_bias: Default is `'none'`. Available options: `'none'`, `'all'`. If you want all biases to be set as trainable, set this to `'all'`.
- use_rslora: Default is `False`. Whether to use `RS-LoRA`.

**DPO Parameters**
- ref_load: The path to load the reference model. Defaults to `None`, which means it will be set to `load`.
- ref_adapter_load: The path to load the ref_adapter weights, default is `None`. If you want to use LoRA weights generated from SFT for DPO, please use "ms-swift>=3.8" and set `--adapter_load sft_ckpt --ref_adapter_load sft_ckpt --finetune true` during training. For resuming training from a checkpoint in this scenario, set `--adapter_load rlhf_ckpt --ref_adapter_load sft_ckpt --finetune false`.
- beta: Has the same meaning as in [TRL](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/main/en/dpo_trainer#trl.DPOConfig). It controls the degree of deviation from the reference model. A higher beta value indicates less deviation from the reference model. For the IPO loss function (`loss_type="ipo"`), beta is the regularization parameter as mentioned in the [paper](https://huggingface.co/papers/2310.12036). Default is 0.1.
- rpo_alpha: A parameter from the [RPO paper](https://huggingface.co/papers/2404.19733) that controls the weight of the NLL term (i.e., the SFT loss) in the loss function, where `loss = dpo_loss + rpo_alpha * sft_loss`. The paper recommends setting it to `1.`. The default value is `None`, meaning the SFT loss is not included by default.
  - Note: In "ms-swift<3.8", the default value was `1.`. Starting from "ms-swift>=3.8", the default has been changed to `None`.
- reference_free: Whether to ignore the provided reference model and implicitly use a reference model that assigns equal probability to all responses. Default is `False`.
- label_smoothing: Default is 0.
- f_divergence_type: Default is `reverse_kl`. See the [TRL documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/main/en/dpo_trainer) for possible values.
- loss_type: Default is `'sigmoid'`. See the [TRL documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/main/en/dpo_trainer) for possible values.


## Training Parameters

Megatron training parameters are inherited from Megatron parameters and basic parameters (shared with ms-swift, such as dataset, template, etc.). For details on basic parameters, please refer to [here](../Instruction/Command-line-parameters.md#base-arguments). Additionally, the following parameters are included:

- add_version: Adds a directory `<version>-<timestamp>` to `save` to prevent overwriting weights, default is True.
- padding_free: Flattens the data in a batch to avoid padding, thereby reducing memory usage and accelerating training. Default is True.
  - If you wish to customize the attention_mask, you can set `--padding_free false`.
  - Note: The Megatron-SWIFT training feature prioritizes support for the padding-free format. Unless under special circumstances, please do not modify this value.
- mlp_padding_free: The default is False. This is used for applying padding-free optimization to the MLP when padding_free is set to false. It allows for improved training speed and reduced memory usage while customizing the attention_mask.
- vit_gradient_checkpointing: Whether to enable gradient checkpointing for the ViT part during multimodal model training. Default: True.
- gradient_checkpointing_kwargs: Arguments passed to `torch.utils.checkpoint`. For example: set `--gradient_checkpointing_kwargs '{"use_reentrant": false}'`. Default: None.
- 🔥packing: Whether to use sequence packing, defaults to False. Currently supports CPT/SFT/DPO.
- packing_length: the length to use for packing. Defaults to None, in which case it is set to max_length.
- streaming: Stream data loading and processing, default is False.
  - Note: Since the length of a streaming dataset cannot be determined, the `--train_iters` parameter must be set. Also set the `max_epochs` parameter to ensure training exits after the specified number of epochs, and to validate and save the model weights accordingly.
  - Note: Streaming datasets can skip preprocessing wait time by overlapping preprocessing with training. Preprocessing for streaming datasets is performed only on rank 0 and then synchronized to other processes via data distribution. This is generally less efficient than the data sharding approach used in non-streaming datasets. When the training world_size is large, preprocessing and data distribution can become a training bottleneck.
- lazy_tokenize: Default is False. If this parameter is set to False, all dataset samples are tokenized before training (this avoids errors during training); if set to True, tokenization occurs during training (this saves memory).
- cached_dataset: Use a cached dataset (generated with `swift export --to_cached_dataset true ...`) during training to avoid GPU time spent on tokenizing large datasets. Default: `[]`.
  - Note: cached_dataset supports `--packing` but does not support `--lazy_tokenize` or `--streaming`.
- max_epochs: Forces the training to exit after reaching `max_epochs`, and performs validation and saving of the model weights. This parameter is especially useful when using a streaming dataset. Default is None.
  - Note: If you use a non-streaming dataset, this parameter will automatically calculate train_iters for you, so there is no need to pass `train_iters` manually.
- enable_dft_loss: Whether to use [DFT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05629) (Dynamic Fine-Tuning) loss in SFT training, default is False.
- enable_channel_loss: Enable channel loss, default is `false`. You need to prepare a "channel" field in your dataset; ms-swift will compute and aggregate the loss grouped by this field. For dataset format, please refer to [channel loss](../Customization/Custom-dataset.md#channel-loss).

## RLHF Parameters

In addition to inheriting the training parameters, the following parameters are also supported:

- rlhf_type: Default is 'dpo'. Currently, only 'dpo' is available.
- loss_scale: Overrides the `loss_scale` in [basic parameters](../Instruction/Command-line-parameters.md). Default is 'last_round'.
- calculate_per_token_loss: Overrides the Megatron parameter. Default is False.
